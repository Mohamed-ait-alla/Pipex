fork() => split the main process into two processes or two lines of executions
		  and returns an id and the child process has always 0. and the child process has
		  exactly the same memory as the main process.
wait() => this function interrupt the main process until the child process complete its 
		  execution. and it waits only for one child process to complete its execution for 
		  example if we have a parent process has two children the first one complete its exe..
		  will terminate the wait and then the parent will terminate its exe.. and we can fix that
		  using a while loop (while (wait(NULL) != -1 || errno != ECHILD)).

pipe() => this function creates or opens two files in memory. the fd[0] is for reading and fd[1] is
		  is for writing and it returns 0 in sucess and -1 it is not.

mkfifo() => its actually named pipe or it does the same job as pipe but it can create just one files
		    and when you try to open that file or reading it the open or write function will block untill
			another process reading or writing to that file.

		#___________exec family function___________#
_execl() => this function executes another program but it will create another process on the top of the main 
			process so it will overwrite the main process and it will execute just what is in its pramaters.
			so we usually call these exec functions in child processes;
_execlp() => this function is the same as _execl(). just this one uses the path variable to look at the path of
			 the executable of a command to execute. so instead ot passing it a the whole path we pass just the
			 name of the command and it will search for this executable file in the system

		#____________duplicate fd functions_________#

dup() => this function takes as a parameter an fd, and it duplicate or clone the current fd and returns a new fd.
dup2() => this function is similar to dup() but it takes another parameter called fd2 and its value that dup2() will
		  assign to the duplicated file , and when an fd is already exist it close it and relplace it with the duplicated
		  even if it 1 or 0 or 2
